            <h2>Professional Teaching Experience</h2>
            <p> Through the university, I am able to complete four professional experience placements units, where I am placed in 
                a range of schools to learn and teach. 
                <br> In second year, I completed two placements. The first was at Santa Sophia Catholic College, 
                and the second was at Marist College Eastwood. In third year, I completed one placement at Gilroy Catholic College.</p>
                
           <h3>Santa Sophia Catholic College</h3>
           <h5>About The School</h5>
            <p>"Santa Sophia is proud to be part of Catholic Schools Parramatta Diocese's system of 
                80 Catholic primary and secondary schools operating across Western Sydney and the Blue Mountains 
                providing more than 43,500 students with a high-quality, low fee Catholic education."<p>
            
            <h5>What Did I Teach?</h5>
            <p> As this was my first placement, I only taught juniors, including years 7 and 8. Over the three weeks, I taught a 
                range of TAS subjects, such as year 7 engineering and electornics, and year 8 timber. I also had the opportunity to 
                run a practical classes for a year 11 hospitality clas and year 9 food technology. 
            </p>

            <h5>Reflective Comment</h5>
            <p> I have gained confidence in myself when teaching in regard to managing the class’s attention 
                and behaviour management. To have confidence in myself, I always have my lesson plans in front of me 
                to keep myself accountable with the timings out each activity and to know what I am going to move onto next. 
                I have taught classes in context areas that I have now done before, which really pushes me out of my comfort zone 
                but when working along side my supervising teacher I was able to understand the concepts and was then able to teach
                it to the students. I have also observed practical assessment tasks for both stage 4 and 5 food tech, which allowed
                 me to understand how to report practical assessments. I have also participated in some co-marking of assessment tasks 
                 against marking criteria and rubrics, which allowed me to identify how to create and use a marking criteria. I have 
                 gained a lot of knowledge on the teaching profession through talking to my supervisor teacher and her colleagues, and 
                 I have thoroughly enjoyed my time on professional experience placement.<p>

            <h3>Marist College Eastwood</h3>
            <h5>About The School</h5>
            <p>Marist College Eastwood is a school that values the importance of honouring individual strengths and talents and nurturing 
                students to work collaboratively, preparing them to take their place in the world beyond the gates of Marist College Eastwood. 
                As Principal, the opportunity to continue driving this strong community forward and driving its vision for the future is an 
                exciting undertaking. Together we will continue to build on the College’s strong Marist tradition, great school spirit and the 
                strength of our wellbeing and values-based approach to education.</p>
            <h5>What Did I Teach?</h5>
            <p>This was my second placement, I taught a larger range of classes. For my three weeks, I taught year 7 timber, year 7 food, 
                year 8 plastics, year 9 timber, year 9 food technology. I also had the opportunity to run practical classes for year 12 hospitality.</p>
            <h5>Reflective Comment</h5>
                <p>As this is my second professional experience placement, I have gained more and more confidence in
                    myself through the help of my supervising teachers. I always accept their feedback and will always
                    take it on board and implement it in my teaching. Working with my main supervising teacher was
                    extremely out of my comfort zone, as he teaches in areas I am not as familiar with, however
                    throughout this block, I have been able to learn and develop my skills in these areas for future
                    reference. There were a few of the same year classes in which my teacher would teach one class and I
                    would teach the second using the information and strategies that he used. I was able to be involved in                    
                    a year 7 food technology practical assessment and a year 10 industrial practical assessment, which
                    gave me the ability to experience different types of assessment types in my chosen faculty. Using this
                    knowledge that I have gained on the placement, as well as my previous placement, I will always
                    endeavour to be the best teacher that I can be.</p>

            <h3>Gilroy Catholic College</h3>
            <h5>About The School</h5>
            <p>Gilroy Catholic College is a co-educational Years 7 to 12 secondary school. 
                Within a Catholic faith environment, our students learn how to be responsible global citizens. 
                Using the latest technologies and leading educational research, we help students learn how to think creatively and critically, 
                how to communicate and to work collaboratively.</p>
            <h5>What Did I Teach?</h5>
            <p> This placement was extremely disconjointed, as the three week block was split into end two weeks of term two, and the first week
                of term three. As a result, I did not have the opportunity to teach many classes. The classes I did take include year 7 digital, year 8 food, 
                year 9 food, and year 10 food.</p>
            <h5>Reflective Comment</h5>
                <p>I have improved in my planning and squencing of lessons.
                    My mid-point comments were to develop my teacher voice
                    and differeniation of activities, to which I believe have been acheived.</p>
